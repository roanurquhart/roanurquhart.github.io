<p>Pokemon Battle Factory.
</p>
<p>
Our group attempted to make a simulation of a mini-game within one of the Pokemon games called The Battle Factory.
In this mini-game the player is given a choice of 3 different Pokemon of which to "rent" and to battle an assortment of other random Pokemon.
The group members involved in making this project possible are Roan Urquhart, Han Wang, and Will Buisson.
Many aspects of the COMP110 course are included in the code of this project. These include:
  if-then statements (both nested and unnested),
  for loops,
  while statments,
  Methods declarations and calls,
  Object initialization and manipulation through the use of the methods, and
  arrays.

Since we were starting a project from scratch we had no idea what to expect in terms of how intensive the work and debugging process would be.
We hoped to include working animations with SceneBuilder windows in order to supplement the game itself, but we soon realized that the goal we hoped
for was not going to be attainable with the time we had before the project due date. So instead we decided to have the code work within eclipse
as a mainly text based application. Although we did manage to make some actual animations in the COMP110 sandbox, we were not able to integrate that
nor SceneBuilder in our project. During our time working on the animations we had to both learn how to sync up the sprite images as well as use photoshop to create images that would seamlessly animate.
Doing all of the work on our own without the guided instructions of a problem set was a great learning experience
that will definitely be useful in all of our careers whether we become computer scientists or otherwise.
The following videos explain the game that our code creates and two animations that we made.</p>

<p>Roan Urquhart - Transferrance of the game rules and mechanics into actual code.
  Will Buisson - The animations included in the video above.
  Han Wang - She was debugged and wrote code that optimized how the game ran.
  We have achieved our short term goal of creating a Pokemon Battle Simulator with some interesting rules. However, in the future we would love to
  include SceneBuilder and the animations within the game loop to create a better player experience. We are very proud of our game and animations though
  as they are proof of our own personal capabilities as programmers and we have really learned how to manipulate Java and use Eclipse, GitKraken, Atom, and
  SceneBuilder to greater effects without specific instructions.
