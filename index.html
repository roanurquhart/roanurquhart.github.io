<p>Pokemon Battle Factory
Our group attempted to make a simulation of a mini-game within one of the Pokemon games called The Battle Factory.
In this mini-game the player is given a choice of 3 different Pokemon of which to "rent" and to battle an assortment of other random Pokemon.
The group members involved in making this project possible are Roan Urquhart, Han Wang, and Will Buisson.
Many aspects of the COMP110 course are included in the code of this project. These include:
  if-then statements (both nested and unnested),
  for loops,
  while statments,
  Methods declarations and calls, and
  Object initialization and manipulation through the use of the methods.
Since we were starting a project from scratch we had no idea what to expect in terms of how intensive the work and debugging process would be.
We hoped to include working animations with SceneBuilder windows in order to supplement the game itself, but we soon realized that the goal we hoped
for was not going to be attainable with the time we had before the project due date. So instead we decided to have the code work within eclipse
as a mainly text based application. Although we did manage to make some actual animations in the COMP110 sandbox, we were not able to integrate that
nor SceneBuilder in our project. Doing all of the work on our own without the guided instructions of a problem set was a great learning experience
that will definitely be useful in all of our careers whether we become computer scientists or otherwise.
